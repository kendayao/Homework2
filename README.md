Responsive Portfolio Project

This project involved creating a responsive portfolio website. The languages used for this project are HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. There are three pages in my website: An about page, a portfolio page, and a contact page. Using Bootstrap, I was able to make each page responsive so they can be viewable on mobile screens. All three pages have a navigation bar at the top of the page where each page can be easily navigated to. Moveover, I added a "connect with me" side bar that links to my Linkedin profile, my git hub repository, and an email message form. On the portfolio section, I will be adding links to different projects overtime. Lastly, I have added a contact page where you can write me a message.
